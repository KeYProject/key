<entry key="SC">
The term label SC is used to indicate that a logical operator has originally been "shortcut" operator.

For instance, both conjunction operators in JML (i.e., &amp;&amp; and &amp;) are translated to the same function in JavaDL. To differentiate between the two, the translation of &amp;&amp; adds the label SC. 

This is relevant for welldefinedness checks.
</entry>

<entry key="origin">
This label saves a term's origin in the JML specification as well as the origins of all of its subterms and former subterms.

For example, if the file "Example.java" contains the clause "requires R" at line 20, then every JavaDL term that is generated from R will have the origin 
"requires @ Example.java @ line 20".

Origin labels are not printed in the sequent view. To see a term's origin, you can mouse over it while holding the ALT button. If you want more detailed information, left click on the term and then on "Show Origin".
