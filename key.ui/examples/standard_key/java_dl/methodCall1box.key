Example showing how a methodcall is evaluated by key. 
This example, in contrast to {@link methodCall1 methodCall1.key}, uses the box modality.
That means it evaluates true, when the program doesn't terminate (normally) or the program terminates (normally) and the postcondition holds. An 
example for a program unnormally terminating would be a not caught top level exception.
Since our program terminates normally and the postcondition holds, this example evaluates true.
