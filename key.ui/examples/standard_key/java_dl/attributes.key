Demonstrates how attributes are accessed in KeY. The suffix <tt>@</tt>
followed by a class name in parentheses disambiguates on the logic side which
attribute is actually addressed. 
<p>
The problem is that there is an attribute <tt>a</tt> declared in
<tt>AdClass</tt> as well as in its subclass <tt>KiAdClass</tt>. Inside the
diamond the addressed attribute can be uniquely identified by considering the
program context and <tt>ac</tt>'s static type. Both informations are not
available resp. cannot be used in the logic. 
<p>
Inside the diamond the attribute of the superclass is assigned the value
<tt>3</tt>, in contrast the attribute <tt>a</tt> declared in the subclass
remains unaltered from its initial value it is set to when executing its
constructor. 
<p>
<em>Note:</em> If no hiding occurs the pretty printer prints and the parser
accepts the program like style, i.e. without the <tt>@</tt> suffix.
