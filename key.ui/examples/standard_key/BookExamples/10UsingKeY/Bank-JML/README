If you are using...

KeY 1.0
=======

From the KeY Book:

"First of all, we activate the JML browser on the directory Bank-JML, by
loading the entire directory, containing JAVA+JML sources into the
system. This is done in the same manner as loading problem files and
proofs by File -> Load or clicking at the load icon in the tool bar . It
is important that we have the directory, here Bank-JML, selected when
pressing the Open button (not any of the contained files)."



KeY 1.4 or newer
================

Contrary to what the KeY Book says, always load the bankjml.key file in
the Bank-JML directory. This will open the JML browser, and you will be
able to select a proof obligation. This is the only method that works.
