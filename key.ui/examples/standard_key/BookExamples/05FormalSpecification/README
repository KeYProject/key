ATM_Example_JML
This directory contains the files ATM.java, BankCard.java  and
CentralHost.java. The Java code plus JML specification from 
Figure 5.14 on page 277 is part of the ATM.java file. 

To run it start the KeY prover ( call runProver) and load the directory. 
The settings for Loop treatment, Method treatment, Query treatment
do not matter. Arithmetic treatment should be basic.
All proof will complete automatically without use interaction.

======================================================================
While-Example_JML
This directory contains the file with the Java+JML example from 
Section 5.3.6 on page 289. The example only considers loop invariants. 
The file WhileDemo.java contains a method that makes use of this while loop 
plus JML specification.

To run it start the KeY prover ( call runProver) and load the directory. 
Make sure that the Proof Search Strategy activates Java DL and  Loop treatment
is set to "Invariant".
The proof proceed automatically with to open goals remaining.  These can
be closed calling an SMT solver.
