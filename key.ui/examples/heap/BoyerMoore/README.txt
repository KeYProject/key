This is a KeY verification example for the Boyer Moore 
majority vote algorithm.

The challenge is as followed:
  Compute in linear time the majority 
  of an array of integers if it
  exists, report its absence otherwise, .
An element m is the majority element if more than half of the 
entries in the array hold m.

Suggested by J.C. Filli√¢tre as an example during VerifyThis 24.

Currently the proofs do not go through automatically, the proof
files are checked in with the example.
