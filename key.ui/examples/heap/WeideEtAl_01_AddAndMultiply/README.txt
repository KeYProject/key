The first benchmark from the paper "Incremental Benchmarks for Software Verification Tools and Techniques" by Bruce W. Weide, Murali Sitaraman, Heather K. Harton, Bruce Adcock, Paolo Bucci, Derek Bronish, Wayne D. Heym, Jason Kirschenbaum and David Frazier: 

Verify an operation that adds two numbers by repeated incrementing. Verify an operation that multiplies two numbers by repeated addition, using the first operation to do the addition. Make one algorithm iterative, the other recursive.

Both proof obligations are verifiable without user interaction.
