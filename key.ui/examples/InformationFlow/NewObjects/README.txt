Information flow examples.

A collection of several examples centering on the problem of low variables of object type and the creation of new objects. The collection includes the examples form the papers "A Logic for Information Flow in Object-Oriented Programs" and "From coupling relations to mated invariants for checking information flow".

The information flow proof obligations of most secure examples can be proved fully automatically using the macro "Full Information Flow Auto Pilot".
