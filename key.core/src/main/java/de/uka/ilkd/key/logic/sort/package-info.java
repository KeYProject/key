/**
 * This package contains different kinds and implementations subtyping interface <tt>Sort</tt>.
 * Each logic term has an assigned a sort. In order to support special concepts like
 * arrays, objects, primitive types, it is useful to support different kinds of sorts.
 * This allows to distinguish diffent categories of terms by looking on the sort type
 * rather than on the name.
 * In KeY we distinguish formulas from terms by the special sort instance
 * <tt>Sort.Formula</tt>.
