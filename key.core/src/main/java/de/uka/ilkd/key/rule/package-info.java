/**
 * This package contains classes for implementing rules. Most rules are
 * taclet rules, represented by {@link
 * de.uka.ilkd.key.rule.Taclet}. The package includes the
 * representation of applications of taclets ({@link
 * de.uka.ilkd.key.rule.TacletApp}) and the builders of taclets ({@link
 * de.uka.ilkd.key.rule.TacletBuilder}). Besides taclets, there are
 * built-in rules implemented directly in Java.
