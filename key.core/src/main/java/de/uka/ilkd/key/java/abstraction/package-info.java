 * <p>
 * There are three implicitly defined entities -
 * {@link recoder.abstraction.ArrayType},
 * {@link recoder.abstraction.DefaultConstructor}, and
 * {@link recoder.abstraction.Package}, as well as the predefined
 * types {@link recoder.abstraction.NullType} and the base class for
 * the small number of {@link recoder.abstraction.PrimitiveType}s.
 * <p>
 * {@link recoder.abstraction.Scope}s are attached to
 * {@link recoder.abstraction.ScopeDefiningElement}s by
 * {@link recoder.service.SourceInfo} implementations and should
