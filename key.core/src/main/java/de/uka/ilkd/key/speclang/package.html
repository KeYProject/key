    This package contains the specification language frontends of KeY. The task 
    of the individual frontends (locates in subpackages such as "jml"), is to
    create objects of the types declared in this package. Core types are Contract,
    OperationContract, and DependencyContract. These are used as input by the 
    proof obligations declared in package proof.init.
