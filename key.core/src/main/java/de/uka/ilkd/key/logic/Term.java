/**
 * In contrast to the distinction of formulas and terms as made by most of the inductive definitions
 * of the syntax of a logic, an instance of this class can stand for a term or a formula. This is
 * done for implementation reasons, as their structure is quite similar and there are good reasons
 * concerning the software's design/architecture (for example using same visitors, reduction of case
 * distinction, unified interfaces etc.). However, they are strictly separated by their sorts. A
 * formula (and just a formula) must have the sort {@link Sort#FORMULA}. Terms of a different sort
 * are terms in the customary logic sense. A term of sort formula is allowed exact there, where a
 * formula in logic is allowed to appear, same for terms of different sorts. Some words about other
 * design decisions:
 * <ol>
 * <li>terms are immutable, this means after a term object is created, it cannot be changed. The
 * advantage is that we can use term sharing and saving a lot of memory space.</li>
 * <li>Term has to be created using the {@link TermFactory} and _not_ by using the constructors
 * itself.</li>
 * <li>Term is subclassed, but all subclasses have to be package private, so that all other classes
 * except {@link TermFactory} know only the class Term and its interface. Even most classes of the
 * logic package.</li>
 * <li>as it is immutable, most (all) attributes should be declared final</li>
 * </ol>
 * Term supports the {@link Visitor} pattern. Two different visit strategies are currently
 * supported: {@link Term#execPostOrder(Visitor)} and {@link Term#execPreOrder(Visitor)}.
