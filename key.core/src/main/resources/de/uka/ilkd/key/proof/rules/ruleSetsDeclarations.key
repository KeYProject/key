<entry key="optimisedSelectRules">
The optimized select rules can be turned off by setting this option to off.

The unoptimized rules use inplace rewriting for the evaluation of select terms. This may lead to heap terms growing exponentially in the number of anons/stores to be evaluated. However, in some rare cases the usage of the unoptimized rules may lead to more human readable sequents.

The optimized rules pull out select terms before they evaluate them. Because other occurences of the same select term are replaced by the Skolem constant introduced by the pullout rule (application of equalities), each select term has to be evaluated only once. Intelligent hiding of no longer needed auxiliary equations holds the sequent human readable and increases performance. The result of the evaluation of a select term is stored such that it can be reapplied immediately if the same select term occurs again.
