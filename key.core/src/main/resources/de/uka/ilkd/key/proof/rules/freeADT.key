// This is the bare bone of the Free data type.
// It is used for 'quick and (not completely) dirty' addition of user-defined
// theories which can be given in the taclet language. The data type is built-in
// into KeY and can be accessed in JML as \free. It always contains at least one
// unique function 'atom', the neutral element. Otherwise, you can define your
// theory around it by adding functions, predicates, and rules. To conform with
// KeY's guidelines, please mark your rules as either axiomatic or lemma. In
// order to prove lemma rules in KeY, axiomatic rules need to syntactically
// appear before others in the file. Example theories can be found under
// $key_maindir/examples/theories. Copy one of these files to this location and
// run 'make copy' or 'ant copy' in $key_maindir/system.
