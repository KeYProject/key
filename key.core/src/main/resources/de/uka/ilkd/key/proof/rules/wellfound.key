// This files declares rules which are used and needed for
// general (non-integer) invariants. In particular lexicographic
// ordering on pairs and sequences is implemented at the moment.
// The supported types are: integers and sequences and
// arbitrarily nested pairs of these types.

// The central predicate is "prec" (for predecessor) which
// captures a wellfounded (Notherian) relation on the type
// any. Its valuation is left underspecified for most cases
// and defined only for sensible applications.

// Additionally, this file also declares predicates to deal with measured-by
// clauses proof obligation. The measuredBy predicate encapsulates the top-level
// measured by clause for the given proof obligation. The measuredByCheck predicate
// is introduced when the measured-by clause is supposed to be checked during the proof.
// The dedicated rules replace this predicate with a suitable prec predicate after finding
// the measuredBy in the assumptions.
