### comment

revealed a bug (would produce (instance 42 sort_any))

Failed also if the translation was
   (assert (not (instanceof (i2u 42) sort_any)))

Added (assert (subtype sort_int sort_any))

### KeY

\problem {
   any::instance(42) = TRUE
}

### contains.1

(assert (not (= (b2u (instanceof (i2u 42) sort_any)) (b2u true))))

### expected

valid
