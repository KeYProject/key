<BODY>
This package contains some basic definitions.
<P>
    The central class of the RECODER system is {@link recoder.ServiceConfiguration}
    which is responsible for maintaining all information repositories. A very
    important repository is the {@link recoder.io.SourceFileRepository}, which
    holds the set of known syntax trees. The construction of new syntax elements
    lays in the responsibility of the {@link recoder.ProgramFactory} which also
    allows access to a parser for the given language or language dialect.
    Other repositories may know about additional abstractions or may
    provide results derived by semantical analyses.
<P>
    Besides of the base repositories, the package also contains some base
    abstractions.
    {@link recoder.ModelElement} is the parent of most other classes of the model.
