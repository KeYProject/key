<BODY>
This package contains the meta model abstractions as used by the
semantical services. The {@link recoder.abstraction.ProgramModelElement}s
hide the origin of the information, be it from Java source code,
Java byte code, or predefined lacking any syntactical representation.
<P>
    There are three implicitly defined entities -
    {@link recoder.abstraction.ArrayType},
    {@link recoder.abstraction.DefaultConstructor}, and
    {@link recoder.abstraction.Package}, as well as the predefined
    types {@link recoder.abstraction.NullType} and the base class for
    the small number of {@link recoder.abstraction.PrimitiveType}s.
<P>
    {@link recoder.java.ScopeDefiningElement}s are initialized by
    {@link recoder.service.SourceInfo} implementations; the corresponding
    methods should not be uses by others.
