This package containes generated list and iterator types.

    <DT>Implementation</DT>
    <DD>
        The elements are addressed by indices rather than iterators or
        explicite nodes. This saves storage and provides a slim interface.
        <P>
            The default implementations end with "ArrayList" and use the common
            array doubling technique.
            If elements must be added and the number is known a-priori (e.g. before
            concatenating a set of lists), it is wise to increase the capacity of the
            array with {@link recoder.list.ObjectArrayList#ensureCapacity}.
    </DD>
    <DT>Genericity</DT>
    <DD>
        The lists are heterogeneous emulations of generic classes.
        Specialized versions inherit from {@link recoder.list.ObjectList} and delegate
        to the "untyped" (i.e. Object type) methods. Since the untyped
        methods are not public in {@link recoder.list.ObjectList}, this is quite safe.
    </DD>
    <DT>Mutability</DT>
    <DD>
        The standard list interfaces are read-only. To modify a list, one must
        use a XYZMutableList that extends the corresponding XYZList interface.
        <P>
            The read-only List interfaces are additionally inherited in parallel to
            the relations between the element types: A {@link recoder.list.ModifierList}
            extends a {@link recoder.list.ProgramElementList} which in turn extends an
            {@link recoder.list.ModelElementList} which extends the
            {@link recoder.list.ObjectList}. With this technique, it is possible
            to add a {@link recoder.list.ModifierList} to a
            {@link recoder.list.ProgramElementMutableList}
            (the {@link recoder.list.ObjectArrayList#add} method expects a
            {@link recoder.list.ProgramElementList} which is a proper superclass of
            {@link recoder.list.ModifierList}).
            Note that to avoid covariance problems (i.e. the preconditions of e.g.
            add methods are not in a sense compatible in polymorphic contexts), the
            mutable lists are <em>not</em> inherited from each other.
