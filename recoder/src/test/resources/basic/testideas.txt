- all literals are constant
- print(parse(print(parse(f)))) = print(parse(f))

- synthetic test cases:
  read single mini-projects (classes, class sets)
  create output (analysis report)
  gzip output
  compare with verified compressed template
  if different, gunzip both, locate and show first difference
