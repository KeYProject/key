/**
 * An object that maps keys to values.  A map cannot contain duplicate keys;
 * each key can map to at most one value.<p>
 *
 * This interface takes the place of the <tt>Dictionary</tt> class, which was
 * a totally abstract class rather than an interface.<p>
 *
 * The <tt>Map</tt> interface provides three <i>collection views</i>, which
 * allow a map's contents to be viewed as a set of keys, collection of values,
 * or set of key-value mappings.  The <i>order</i> of a map is defined as
 * the order in which the iterators on the map's collection views return their
 * elements.  Some map implementations, like the <tt>TreeMap</tt> class, make
 * specific guarantees as to their order; others, like the <tt>HashMap</tt>
 * class, do not.<p>
 *
 * Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map keys.
 * The behavior of a map is not specified if the value of an object is changed
 * in a manner that affects equals comparisons while the object is a
 * key in the map.  A special case of this prohibition is that it is not
 * permissible for a map to contain itself as a key.  While it is permissible
 * for a map to contain itself as a value, extreme caution is advised: the
 * equals and hashCode methods are no longer well defined on a such a map.<p>
 *
 * All general-purpose map implementation classes should provide two
 * "standard" constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor which creates an
 * empty map, and a constructor with a single argument of type <tt>Map</tt>,
 * which creates a new map with the same key-value mappings as its argument.
 * In effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any map,
 * producing an equivalent map of the desired class.  There is no way to
 * enforce this recommendation (as interfaces cannot contain constructors) but
 * all of the general-purpose map implementations in the SDK comply.
