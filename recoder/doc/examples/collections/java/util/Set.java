/**
 * A collection that contains no duplicate elements.  More formally, sets
 * contain no pair of elements <code>e1</code> and <code>e2</code> such that
 * <code>e1.equals(e2)</code>, and at most one null element.  As implied by
 * its name, this interface models the mathematical <i>set</i> abstraction.<p>
 *
 * The <tt>Set</tt> interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
 * inherited from the <tt>Collection</tt> interface, on the contracts of all
 * constructors and on the contracts of the <tt>add</tt>, <tt>equals</tt> and
 * <tt>hashCode</tt> methods.  Declarations for other inherited methods are
 * also included here for convenience.  (The specifications accompanying these
 * declarations have been tailored to the <tt>Set</tt> interface, but they do
 * not contain any additional stipulations.)<p>
 *
 * The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly,
 * that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements
 * (as defined above).<p>
 *
 * Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set
 * elements.  The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object
 * is changed in a manner that affects equals comparisons while the object is
 * an element in the set.  A special case of this prohibition is that it is
 * not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element.
