<H2>Troubleshooting</H2>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><EM>Q:</EM></DT>
<DD><EM>My compiler seems to have problems with <CODE>SourceElement.Position</CODE></EM></DD>
<P></P>
<DT><EM>A:</EM></DT>
<DD>Compilers that work correctly are <CODE>jikes</CODE> or <CODE>javac</CODE>.
You might also want to help your compiler by providing (redundant)
<CODE>public static</CODE> modifiers in front of the member class declaration
(IBM Visual Age), or the fully qualified name if the name resolution fails
(Inprise JBuilder).

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><EM>Q:</EM></DT>
<DD><EM>There are lots of deprecation warnings during compilation.</EM></DD>
<P></P>
<DT><EM>A:</EM></DT>
<DD>Usually, compilers will not report deprecation warnings. You can
safely ignore them; we use the <CODE>@deprecated</CODE> tag to mark
unfinished, "risky" methods that custom applications should avoid.
These methods will be removed or refined in later versions.

<DT><EM>Q:</EM></DT>
<DD><EM>RECODER does not seem to find a file which is in the search path?!</EM></DD>
<P></P>
<DT><EM>A:</EM></DT>
<DD>The file name might be expanded into an absolute path. Currently, the
    repositories handle relative file names only. Simply add the system root
        to your search path (<CODE>"/."</CODE> for Unix systems).

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><EM>Q:</EM></DT>
<DD><EM>The pretty printer shifts my comments in certain cases - why?</EM></DD>
<P></P>
<DT><EM>A:</EM></DT>
<DD>This is a technical problem. Comments are usually skipped in
    common parsers, so we had to assign them later on. To do so, we need
    a syntactical hook to attach comments to. However, the parser does not
    represent all implicit terminal tokens such as ",", ";", or "}".
    Hence comments are shifted somewhat as they are attached at the following
    explicit token. You can observe such effects at the end of member or
    statement blocks, especially with commented-out regions in otherwise
    empty statements.    
    <BR>
    Since any fix for that problem requires some grave changes to the parser,
    do not expect to see that fix soon.

<H2>Design Questions</H2>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><EM>Q:</EM></DT>
<DD><EM>Why did you introduce that many lists?</EM></DD>
<P></P>
<DT><EM>A:</EM></DT>
<DD>Java did not provide parameterized (generic/template) types at time of development 
    and we felt the need to provide type safe containers in public interfaces.
    The pattern applied here provides us with a workaround.</DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><EM>Q:</EM></DT>
<DD><EM>Why are the java.util.Collection classes not used for Lists, Sets and so on?</EM></DD>
<P></P>
<DT><EM>A:</EM></DT>
<DD>Two reasons: First, at the time of writing, there was no recommendable
    JDK available for the primary development platform Linux, so we had to
    remain compatible with JDK 1.1. Second, our implementations require
    significantly less memory and are - for most objects - faster than the 
    standard implementations. Unfortunately, the Collection interfaces are not
    trivial to support by now, so no attempt was made.
    This is partly due to the underlaying implementation; for instance,
    iteration over entry pairs for instance would never become very 
    efficient as we use a different layout internally. Lists are clearly
    not really compatible, even though one could attempt to make
    ObjectMutableList a subtype of java.util.List.

<!--
Q: Why do several program elements have multiple parent fields?
A: This expresses the different roles an element can play, or the
   different contexts it can be embedded within. A method reference,
   for instance, can be part of an object access path, a part of an
   expression, or used as a statement. It is sometimes important to
   know this role, so we encoded them in separate fields unless the roles
   could be separated by the type of the parent.
