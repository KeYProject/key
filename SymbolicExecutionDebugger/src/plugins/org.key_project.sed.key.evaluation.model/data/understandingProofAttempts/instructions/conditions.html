      <h1>Understanding Proof Attempts</h1>
      <p>
         The goal of the evaluation is to compare the inspection of proof attempts using <a href="http://www.key-project.org" target="_blank">KeY</a> and the <a href="http://www.key-project.org/eclipse/SED/index.html" target="_blank">Symbolic Execution Debugger (SED)</a>.
         During the evaluation, four proofs and related questions will be shown to you. 
         You can contribute to the evaluation by answering these questions as best as you can.
         The evaluation usually takes about 60 minutes.
