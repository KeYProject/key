A collection of examples for modelling dependencies / secure information flow using ghost state.

ArrayList: A variation of the ArrayList class from the "list" example, where the proof obligations for the dependency contracts have been encoded into ghost state and method contracts. These method contract proof obligations should be verifiable without direct user interaction. The regular dependency proof obligations are meaningless here.
