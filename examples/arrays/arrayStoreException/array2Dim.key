@see <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/arrays.html#10.10">ArrayStoreException (JLS 3rd, 10.10)</a>

A proof attempt of the example below will get stuck with two goals left
open. The reason is that it cannot be assured that the object stored in
<tt>a[0][0]</tt> is assignment compatible to the component type of array <tt>a[1]</tt>
and <tt>a[2]</tt>. In fact it must not be the case as e.g. <tt>a[0][0]</tt> may be of type
<tt>CSub3</tt> and <tt>a[1], a[2]</tt> may be arrays of component type <tt>CSub12</tt>
which is not assignment compatible to <tt>CSub3</tt>.

In such cases Java throws an <tt>ArrayStoreException</tt> which is not caught
by the program in this example and therefore termination cannot be proven.
