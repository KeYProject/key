Search In Two Arrays algorithm as shown at the KeY tutorials in the RS3 project and at CADE 2013.

Class SITA3 keeps two arrays of integers. Three methods are declared: Method commonEntry(l,r) returns the smallest index between l and r such that both have the same entry. Method swap(a,pos1,pos2) swaps the entries a[pos1] and a[pos2]. Method rearrange() changes the two arrays such that all common entries are moved to the front. The specification so far does not state that rearrange() produces permutations.
