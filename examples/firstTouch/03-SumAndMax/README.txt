The first challenge from the Verified Software Competition (VSComp) at VSTTE'10, organised by Peter MÃ¼ller and Natarajan Shankar: 

Given an N-element array of natural numbers, write a program to compute the sum and the maximum of the elements in the array.

This is the solution created by the KeY team during the competition using development version 1.5, slightly adapted for KeY 2.0.

The single proof obligation is verifiable without user interaction (but note that "Arithmetic Treatment" is switched to "Model Search" in the strategy configuration).
