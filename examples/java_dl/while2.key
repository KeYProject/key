Proof example showing how a program containing a loop is evaluated without interaction.<br>
The loop in this example will be an infinite loop, if the value it is invoked is not 3.<br>
Terms of the type <tt>[p] true</tt> are tautologies due to the nature of the
box modality. Because of that, the loop will not be of interest to key.
