Example showing how a methodcall is evaluated by key, using the diamond modality.
A diamond modality <p> phi evaluates true, if and only if the program p 
terminates in a state that holds the condition phi. If the program 
doesn't terminate or terminates not normally (i.e. through an uncaught 
exception), the formula will evaluate false.
