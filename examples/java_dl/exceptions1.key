@author Sebastian Wirkert (doc)

Proof example showing how exceptions are handled.  After the exception is
thrown, java completes the try block abruptly and tries to find a suited catch
clause (the object thrown has to be an instanceof the declared parameter
type).<br> Since <tt>NullPointerEception</tt> is a subtype of
<tt>RuntimeException</tt>, the catch clause will be executed.<br> Of course, the
finally clause will still be executed after the catch clause is done.
