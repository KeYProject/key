Demonstrates correct symbolic execution of a <tt>return</tt> statement
surrounded by a try-block in presence of a finally-block.<br>

When a return statement is executed, it attempts to transfer the control back
to the invoker of the method. If the <tt>return</tt> statement is surrounded
by a <tt>try</tt> block, then a possible finally block will be executed before
the control is transfered. Notice, the <tt>return</tt> value is
evaluated before the statements of the finally block are executed.
