/**
 *
 * This example demonstrates a bug source caused by the
 * dangling else problem. I came across this example twice in the 
 * last week: 
 *
 *   1) when assisting in translating a pascal parser from antlr v2 to antlr v3
 *
 *   2) on the git mailing list where during a discussion about coding styles
 *      a template of the example used below emerged.
 *
 *  The problem stated here cannot be proven. There are two possible 
 *  solutions to this. See: 
 *     a) danglingElseSolution1.key 
 *     b) danglingElseSolution2.key
