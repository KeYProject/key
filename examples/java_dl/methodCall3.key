Example containing a recursive method invocation.
Because the if statement evaluates false,
	<i>recurse(true);</i>
will be called, recursively calling the method recurse.<br>
This method is executed, but the evaluated value is discarded, since it is not
assigned. 
Now our programm continues normally, returning the local variable x, which
holds the value 1. <br> 
Note that if the recursive method invocation statement would have been
	   <tt>return recurse(true);</tt>
our originally called method would have returned 0, since that is the value,
	    <tt>recurse(true);</tt>
evaluates.
