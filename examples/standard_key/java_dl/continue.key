Proof example showing how labeled continue statements are evaluated.  A
labeled continue statement always completes abruptly and attempts to transfer
control to the enclosing labeled statement. This labeled statement, called
continue target, then immediately ends the current iteration and beginns a new
one.<br> The preceding description says "attempts to transfer control" rather
than just "transfers control" because if there are any try statements within
the continue target whose try blocks contain the continue statement, then any
finally clauses of those try statements are executed, in order, innermost to
outermost, before control is transferred to the continue target. Abrupt
completion of a finally clause can disrupt the transfer of control initiated
by a continue statement.
