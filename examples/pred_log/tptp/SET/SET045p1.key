// Version  : Especial.
// English  : The restricted comprehension axiom says : given a set 
//            z, there is a set \forall S of whose members are drawn from z and 
//            which satisfy some property. If there were a universal set, 
//            then the Russell set could be formed, using this axiom. 
//            So given the appropriate instance of this axiom, there 
//            is no universal set.
