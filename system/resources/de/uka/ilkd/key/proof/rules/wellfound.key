// ordering on pairs and sequences is implemented at the moment.
// The supported types are: integers and sequences and 
// arbitrarily nested pairs of these types.

// The central predicate is "prec" (for predecessor) which
// captures a wellfounded (Notherian) relation on the type 
// any. Its valuation is left underspecified for most cases
// and defined only for sensible applications.
