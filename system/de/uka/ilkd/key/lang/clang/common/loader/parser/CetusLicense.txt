The Cetus Artistic License

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may 
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic 
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the 
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary 
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

    * "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright 
       Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through 
       textual modification.
    * "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or
       has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
    * "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for 
       the package.
    * "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this 
       Package.
    * "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of 
       media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. 
       (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but 
       only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the 
       fee.)
    * "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, 
       though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means 
       that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions 
       they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the 
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you 
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived 
from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in 
such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided 
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when 
you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them 
       Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an 
       equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site 
       such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your 
       modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable 
form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, 
       together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where 
       to get the Standard Version.  The Standard Version may be obtained here: 
       http://www.ece.purdue.edu/ParaMount/Cetus

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the 
       Package with your modifications.  Java class files and archives
       (JAR files) supplied by you and called from the modified Package shall
       be considered part of the modified Package for redistribution purposes,
       to the extent that ANY of your modifications would be useless without
       those class files and archives.

    c) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not 
charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package 
in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger 
(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise 
this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from 
the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of 
this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold 
commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote 
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

8. If you did not receive this Package directly from the Copyright Holder, then 
you are encouraged to notify the Copyright Holder by sending e-mail to
cetus@ecn.purdue.edu for the purpose of estimating the number of users and 
listing various uses of the Package.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
