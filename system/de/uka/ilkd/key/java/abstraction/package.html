<BODY>
This package contains the meta model abstractions as used by the
semantical services. The {@link recoder.abstraction.ProgramModelElement}s
hide the origin of the information, be it from Java source code,
Java byte code, or predefined lacking any syntactical representation.
<P>
There are three implicitly defined entities -
{@link recoder.abstraction.ArrayType},
{@link recoder.abstraction.DefaultConstructor}, and
{@link recoder.abstraction.Package}, as well as the predefined
types {@link recoder.abstraction.NullType} and the base class for
the small number of {@link recoder.abstraction.PrimitiveType}s.
<P>
{@link recoder.abstraction.Scope}s are attached to 
{@link recoder.abstraction.ScopeDefiningElement}s by
{@link recoder.service.SourceInfo} implementations and should 
not be modified from others.
