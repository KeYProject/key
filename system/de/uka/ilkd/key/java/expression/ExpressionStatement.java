 *  An ExpressionStatement is a statement that may appear as an expression.

 *  Strictly speaking, Java would allow any expression as a statement;
 *  however, this does not make much sense (except backward compatibility to
 *  awkward C code) and is even forbidden in dialects (such as Generic Java).
