    <p> provides a representation for the term and sequent
      structure. The structure of a term is defined in {@link
      de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Term}. Subclasses of {@link
      de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Term} provide representations for special
      kinds of terms. However, these subclasses are supposed to be not
      directly accessed. Instead, {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Term}
      provides methods for all the methods of the
      subclasses. Moreover, {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Term}s (or
      their subclasses) are supposed to be never constructed by
      constructors of their own, but by instances of {@link
      de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.TermFactory}. </p> 
    <p> The function of {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Term}s (e.g., if
      they represent a conjunction of subterms, a quantified
      formula,...) is only determined by an {@link
      de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.op.Operator} that is assigned to a {@link
      de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Term} when the {@link
      de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Term} is constructed.</p> 
    <p> {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Sequent}s consist of two {@link
      de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Semisequent}s which represent a
      duplicate-free list of a {@link
      de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.ConstrainedFormula}s. The latter consist of
      a {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Constraint} and a {@link
      de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Term} of a special sort {@link
      de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.sort.Sort#FORMULA}. </p>
    <p> {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Sequent}s and {@link
      de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Term}s are <b>immutable</b>.
