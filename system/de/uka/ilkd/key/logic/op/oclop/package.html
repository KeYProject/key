    Used for OCL Simplification, i.e. not for usual logic terms.
    The operators in this package 
    makes it possible to build OCL expressions in the form of
    {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Term}s, with the ultimate goal of
    applying simplification taclets to these {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.Term}s
    and then pretty-print the simplified expressions back to usual 
    OCL syntax again.
    Most of the pre-defined OCL operations can be expressed using
    {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.op.Function}, but some of them
    need more complex operators. These more complex
    operators are collected in this package. There is also in this
    package a class {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.op.oclop.OclOp} containing
    all pre-defined OCL operations, also the ones based on 
    {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.op.Function}, in form of constants. 
    The operators defined in this package all extend 
    {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.op.TermSymbol}.
    One thing that makes {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.op.Function}
    inappropriate to use for some OCL operations is the fact
    that it assumes that the type/sort of a term is only dependent
    on its top-level operator, while in OCL the type of an
    expression can also depend on its sub expressions. For example:

    <i>collection->iterate(elem ; acc:T=init_expr | expr_with_elem_and_acc)</i>

    The type of this expression is determined by the type of the
    accumulator <i>acc</i>.
