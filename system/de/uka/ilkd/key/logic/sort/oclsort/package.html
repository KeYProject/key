    Used for OCL Simplification, i.e. not for usual logic terms.
    Instead of creating the sorts in this package directly, 
    use the constants defined in
    {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.sort.oclsort.OclSort}.

    This package contains representations of the pre-defined types
    in OCL: <b>OclAny</b>, <b>OclType</b>, <b>Boolean</b>, <b>Real</b>, 
    <b>Integer</b>, <b>String</b>.
    It also contains means to represent the pre-defined Collection
    types: <b>Collection(T)</b>, <b>Set(T)</b>, <b>Bag(T)</b>, 
    and <b>Sequence(T)</b>, where
    <b>T</b> is one of the types enumerated above.
    Moreover, we need a type that represents the classifiers
    defined in the UML model associated with a specific OCL constraint.
    We call this representation {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.sort.oclsort.ClassifierSort}. 
    This sort can be
    viewed as a super type of all classifiers in the model.
    We don't need more specific type information of the classifiers, 
    since our simplification rules are based only on our knowledge
    of the pre-defined OCL operations - not the properties of a
    specific UML model.
    Finally, to be able to check for type conformance when building
    OCL expressions, we need a sort called 
    {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.sort.oclsort.OclGenericSort}. Its existence
    is motivated in the context of assigning an element type to
    an empty Collection. The problem is that when we, for instance,
    build an expression like <b>collection->forAll(s:T | e(s))</b>
    we want to check that the element type of <b>collection</b> conforms
    to the type <b>T</b>. This must hold also for the special case:
    <b>Set{}->forAll(s:T | e(s))</b>. In other words, the element type of
    <b>Set{}</b> must conform to every other basic type. At the same time,
    when we build a collection, we want to check that the types of 
    the elements in the collection conforms to the element type of 
    the collection. Using the taclet syntax, <b>$insert_set(elem, $empty_set)</b>,
    we want to check that the type of <b>elem</b> conforms to the element
    type of <b>$empty_set/Set{}</b>. In other words, the element type of
    <b>Set{}</b> must be such that any other basic type conforms to it.
    We therefore need a type with the property that it conforms to
    any other basic type, and any other basic type conforms to it.
    {@link de.uka.ilkd.key.logic.sort.oclsort.OclGenericSort} has this property.
