    This package contains different kinds and implementations subtyping interface <tt>Sort</tt>. 
    Each logic term has an assigned a sort. In order to support special concepts like 
    arrays, objects, primitive types, it is useful to support different kinds of sorts.
    This allows to distinguish diffent categories of terms by looking on the sort type 
    rather than on the name.  
     In KeY we distinguish formulas from terms by the special sort instance 
    <tt>Sort.Formula</tt>.
