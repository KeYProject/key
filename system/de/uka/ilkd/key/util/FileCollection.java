 * This class encapsulates a collection of files which is arbitrarily organised.
 * It is iterable and allows to open all files (not directories) during the
 * iteration as streams.
 * 
 * Subclasses allow to iterate a jar/zip-file or a directory.
 * 
 * Typical usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   FileCollection fc = ... ;
 *   FileCollection.Walker walker = fc.createWalker(".java");
 *   while(walker.step()) {
 *      // use the data of current location via walker.getCurrent...()
 *   }
 * </pre>
