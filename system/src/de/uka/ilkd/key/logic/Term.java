/** 
 * In contrast to the distinction of formulas and terms as made by most of the 
 * inductive definitions of the syntax of a logic, an instance of this class can
 * stand for a term or a formula. This is done for implementation reasons, as
 * their structure is quite similar and there are good reasons concerning the
 * software's design/architecture (for example using same visitors, reduction of
 * case distinction, unified interfaces etc.). However, they are strictly
 * separated by their sorts. A formula (and just a formula) must have 
 * the sort {@link Sort#FORMULA}. Terms of a different sort are terms in the
 * customary logic sense. A term of sort formula is allowed exact there, where a
 * formuala in logic is allowed to appear, same for terms of different sorts. 
 *   Some words about other design decisions: 
 * <ol> 
 *  <li> terms are immutable, this means after a term object is created, it
 *  cannot be changed. The advantage is that we can use term sharing and
 *  saving a lot of memory space. 
 *  </li>
 *  <li> Term has to be created using the {@link TermFactory} and
 *    <emph>not</emph> by using the constructors itself. 
 *  </li>
 *  <li> Term is subclassed, but all subclasses have to be package private, so
 *    that all other classes except {@link TermFactory} know only the class
 *    Term and its interface. Even most classes of the logic package.
 *  </li>
 *  <li> as it is immutable, most (all) attributes should be declared final
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * Term supports the {@link Visitor} pattern. Two different visit strategies are
 * currently supported: {@link Term#execPostOrder(Visitor)} and
 * {@link Term#execPreOrder(Visitor)}.
