### Comment

Unfortunately this cannot be proved automatically.
Apparently TRUE is not translated as TRUE, but as (b2u true)

### KeY

\predicates { p; }
\functions { boolean b; }

\problem { (p <-> b=TRUE) -> (!p <-> b=FALSE) }

### contains.1

(declare-fun u_p () Bool)
(declare-fun u_b () U)

### contains.2

(assert (not (=> (= u_p (= u_b (b2u true))) (= (not u_p) (= u_b (b2u false))))))

### expected

valid
