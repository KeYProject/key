    This package contains classes for implementing rules. Most rules are
    taclet rules, represented by {@link
    de.uka.ilkd.key.rule.Taclet}. The package includes the
    representation of applications of taclets ({@link
    de.uka.ilkd.key.rule.TacletApp}) and the builders of taclets ({@link
    de.uka.ilkd.key.rule.TacletBuilder}). Besides taclets, there are
    built-in rules implemented directly in Java.
