/**
 * This class pretty-prints information using line breaks and
 * indentation.  For instance, it can be used to print
 * <pre>
 *   while (i>0) {
 *     i--;
 *     j++;
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * instead of 
 * <pre>
 *   while (i>0) { i
 *   --; j++;}
 * </pre>
 * if a maximum line width of 15 characters is chosen.
 *
 * <P>The formatted output is directed to a <em>backend</em> which
 * might write it to an I/O stream, append it to the text of a GUI
 * componenet or store it in a string.  The {@link Backend} interface
 * encapsulates the concept of backend.  Apart from handling the
 * output, the backend is also asked for the available line width and
 * for the amount of space needed to print a string.  This makes it
 * possible to include e.g. HTML markup in the output which does not
 * take up any space.  There are two convenience implementations
 * {@link WriterBackend} and {@link StringBackend}, which write the
 * output to a {@link java.io.Writer}, resp. a 
 *
 * {@link java.lang.String}.
 *
 * <P>The layouter internally keeps track of a current <em>indentation
 * level</em>.  Think of nicely indented Java source code.  Then the
 * indentation level at any point is the number of blank columns to be
 * inserted at the begining of the next line if you inserted a line
 * break.  To increase the indentation level of parts of the text, the
 * input to the layouter is separated into <em>blocks</em>.  The
 * indentation level changes when a block is begun, and it is reset to
 * its previous value when a block is ended.  Of course, blocks maybe
 * nested.
 *
 * <P>In order to break text among several lines, the layouter needs
 * to be told where line breaks are allowed.  A <em>break</em> is a
 * position in the text where there is either a line break (with
 * appropriate indentation) or a number of spaces, if enough material
 * fits in one line.  In order to handle the indentation level
 * properly, breaks should only occur inside blocks.  There are in
 * fact two kinds of blocks: <em>consistent</em> and
 * <em>inconsistent</em> ones.  In a consistent block, line are broken
 * either at all or at none of the breaks.  In an inconsistent block,
 * as much material as possible is put on one line before it is
 * broken.
 *
 * <P>Consider the program above.  It should be printed either as
 * <pre>
 *   while (i>0) { i--; j++; }
 * </pre>
 * or, if there is not enough space on the line, as
 * <pre>
 *   while (i>0) {
 *     i--;
 *     j++;
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Given a Layouter object <code>l</code>, we could say:
 * <pre>
 * l.begin(true,2).print("while (i>0) {").brk(1,0)
 *  .print("i--;").brk(1,0)
 *  .print("j++;").brk(1,-2)
 *  .print("{").end();
 * </pre>
 *
 * The call to {@link #begin(boolean,int)} starts a consistent block,
 * increasing the indentation level by 2.  The {@link #print(String)}
 * methods gives some actual text to be output.  The call to {@link
 * #brk(int,int)} inserts a break.  The first argument means that one
 * space should be printed at this position if the line is
 * <em>not</em> broken.  The second argument is an offset to be added
 * to the indentation level for the next line, if the line <em>is</em>
 * broken.  The effect of this parameter can be seen in the call
 * <code>brk(1,-2)</code>.  The offset of <code>-2</code> outdents the
 * last line by 2 positions, which aligns the closing brace with the
 * <code>with</code>.
 *
 * <p>If the lines in a block are broken, one sometimes wants to insert
 * spaces up to the current indentation level at a certain position
 * without allowing a line break there.  This can be done using the
 * {@link #ind(int,int)} method.  For instance, one wants to output either
 * <pre>
 *   ...[Good and Bad and Ugly]...
 * </pre>
 * or
 * <pre>
 *   ...[    Good
 *       and Bad
 *       and Ugly]...
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note the four spaces required before <code>Good</code>.  We do this
 * by opening a block which sets the indentation level to the column where the <code>G</code> ends up and outdenting the lines with the <code>and</code>:
 * <pre>
 *   l.print("...[").begin(true,4).ind(0,0).print("Good").brk(1,-4)
 *    .print("and ").print("Bad").brk(1,-4)
 *    .print("and ").print("Ugly").end().print("]...");
 * </pre>
 *
 * Again, the first argument to {@link #ind(int,int)} is a number of
 * spaces to print if the block we are in is printed on one line.  The
 * second argument is an offset to be added to the current indentation
 * level to determine the column to which we should skip.
 *
 * <p>When all text has been sent to a Layouter and all blocks have been
 * ended, the {@link #close()} method should be closed.  This sends
 * all pending output to the backend and invokes the {@link
 * Backend#close()} method, which usually closes I/O streams, etc.
 *
 * <p>Some applications need to keep track of where certain parts of the
 * input text end up in the output.  For this purpose, the Layouter
 * class provides the {@link #mark(Object)} method.  
 *
 * <P>The public methods of this class may be divided into two
 * categories: A small number of <em>primitive</em> methods, as
 * described above, and a host of <em>convenience</em> methods which
 * simplify calling the primitive ones for often-used arguments.  For
 * instance a call to {@link #beginC()} is shorthand for
 * <code>begin(true,ind)</code>, where <code>ind</code> is the default
 * indentation selected when the Layouter was constructed.
 *
 * <P>Most of the methods can throw an {@link UnbalancedBlocksException},
 * which indicates that the sequence of method calls was illegal, i.e.
 * more blocks were ended than begun, the Layouter is closed before all
 * blocks are ended, a break occurs outside of any block, etc.
 *
 * <P>Also, most methods can throw an {@link java.io.IOException}.
 * This only happens if a called method in the backend throws an
 * IOException, in which case that exception is passed through to the
 * caller of the Layouter method.
