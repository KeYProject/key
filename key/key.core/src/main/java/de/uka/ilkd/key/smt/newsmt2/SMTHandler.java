/**
 * General interface for routines that translate particular KeY data structures
 * to SMT.
 *
 * SMT handlers are loaded via a {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}.
 *
 * To implement a new handler, implement this interface and add the classname to
 * a file that ServiceLoader reads for SMTHandler.
 *
 * <h2>Procedure</h2>
 *
 * SMT handlers are created using the default constructor without parameters
 * They are always used within the same proof, but possibly for several proof
 * obligations.
 *
 * After creation, the {@link #init(Services)} method is called that injects the
 * {@link Services} object belonging to the proof.
 *
 * During translation, an SMT handler can be asked via {@link #canHandle(Term)}
 * if it can translate a term into smt.
 *
 * If it returns true, the method {@link #handle(MasterHandler, Term)} will be
 * called which returns the SMT result in form of an {@link SExpr}.
