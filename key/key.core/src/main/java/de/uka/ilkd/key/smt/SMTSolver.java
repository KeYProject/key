/**
 * The SMTSolver interface represents a solver process (e.g. Z3, Simplify,...)

 * process and its result. A object of <code>SMTSolver</code> is, therefore,
 * related to exactly one object of typ <code>SMTProblem</code>. Each object of
 * <code>SMTSolver</code> has a specific solver type (<code>SolverType</code>),

 * Note:<br>
 *A class that implements this interface should be thread safe since there
