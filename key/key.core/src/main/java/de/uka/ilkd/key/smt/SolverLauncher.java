/**
 * IN ORDER TO START THE SOLVERS USE THIS CLASS.<br>
 * There are two cases how the solvers can be started:<br>
 * <br>
 * 1. Case: Starting the solvers synchronously<br>
 *<br>
 * First Step: Create the SMT problem:<br>
 * <code>SMTProblem problem = new SMTProblem(g); // g can be either a goal or term</code>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * Second Step: Create the launcher object:<br>
 * <code>SolverLauncher launcher = new SolverLauncher(new SMTSettings(){...});</code>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * Third Step: Launch the solvers you want to execute<br>
 * <code>launcher.launch(problem, services,SolverType.Z3_SOLVER,SolverType.YICES_SOLVER);</code>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * Forth Step: Get the final result<br>
 * <code>return problem.getFinalResult();</code><br>
 * <br>
 * In case that you want to access the result of each solver:<br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * for (SMTSolver solver : problem.getSolvers()) {
 *     solver.getFinalResult();
 * }
 *</pre>
 * 
 * <br>
 * 
 * 2. Case: Starting the solvers asynchronously:<br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {        
 * public void run() {
 *   SMTProblem final problem = new SMTProblem(...);
 *   SolverLauncher launcher = new SolverLauncher(new SMTSettings(...));
 *   launcher.addListener(new SolverLauncherListener(){
 *          public void launcherStopped(SolverLauncher launcher, Collection<SMTSolver> problemSolvers){
 *          	// do something with the results here...
 *          	problem.getFinalResult();
 *          	// handling the problems that have occurred:
 *          	for(SMTSolver solver : problemSolvers){
 *          		solver.getException();
 *          		...
 *          	}
 *          }
 *          public void launcherStarted(Collection<SMTProblem> problems,
 *                                      Collection<SolverType> solverTypes,
 *                                      SolverLauncher launcher);
 *     		 });
 *   launcher.launch(problem,services,SolverType.Z3_SOLVER,SolverType.YICES_SOLVER);
 * 	      
 * 	        }
 * 	    });
 *    thread.start();
 *</pre>
 * 
 * <br>
 *NOTE: In case that you add at least one listener to a launcher no exception
 * is thrown when a solver produces an error. The exceptions of the solvers are
 * stored within the solver object and can be accessed by
 * <code>solver.getException</code>.
