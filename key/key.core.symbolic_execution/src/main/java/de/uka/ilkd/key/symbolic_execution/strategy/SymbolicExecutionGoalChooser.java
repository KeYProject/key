/**
 * <p>
 * This {@link GoalChooser} is a special implementation of the default
 * {@link DepthFirstGoalChooser}. The difference is that a rule which
 * creates a new symbolic execution tree node on a {@link Goal} is only applied
 * if all other {@link Goal}s will also creates new symbolic execution tree
 * nodes. This has the advantage that invalid branches may closed before
 * new symbolic execution tree nodes are created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The order in which new symbolic execution tree nodes are created is also
 * managed by this {@link GoalChooser}. The idea is that on each {@link Goal}
 * a new symbolic execution tree node is created before on one {@link Goal}
 * a second one will be created. This has the affect that for instance on all 
 * branches of a branch statement the next statement is evaluated before the first  
 * branch executes the second statement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A second criteria is the used custom {@link StopCondition} of the current
 * {@link Proof}. {@link Goal}s on that the next set node is allowed are
 * preferred to branches on which is not allowed. This is required to make
 * sure that for instance a step over or step return result is completely
 * performed on all {@link Goal}s before on one {@link Goal} a further
 * set node is executed. 
 * </p>
