RECODER is LGPL'ed software. Check the license if you are not familiar with it.

<P>
As RECODER is still in its infancy, do not expect industrial strength
in terms of usability, reliability, or efficiency. RECODER is not yet
mature and parts of the API might change rather frequently.

<P>
There is no dedicated install program, but setup and installation are
easily done.
</P>

<A NAME="requirements"><H3>System Requirements</H3></A>
<P>
A complete installation of RECODER requires approximately 25&nbsp;MB HD space.
To run, RECODER requires a Java Virtual Machine Version 1.1 or higher, and
a good bunch of memory, depending on your project. As a rule of thumb,
RECODER requires less memory than one needs to create the JavaDoc pages
for the target system.
</P>

<A NAME="installation"><H3>Installation Procedure</H3></A>
<P>
Step 1: Download the current RECODER distribution.
</P>
<P>
Step 2: Add <CODE>recoder.jar</CODE> to your CLASSPATH.
</P>
<P>
Step 3: If you are new to RECODER, you may want to check out the

Public releases are available at
<A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=28173">sourceforge</A>.
The "core" distribution archive does not contain the API documentation or
developer files, but it does include all the documentation materials from
this site.
To unpack the bzip2'ed versions, you need the corresponding
<CODE>bunzip2</CODE> tool, which is
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/#bzip2-latest">available</A>
for most platforms.
</P>
<P>
To access the latest version, you must use the anonymous CVS access; please
consult the corresponding pages on sourceforge for instructions.
Releases prior to 0.70 are available from the <A HREF="http://i44w3.info.uni-karlsruhe.de/~compost/archive">COMPOST archive</A>.

Release notes for 0.82 (of September 27, 2007)
<hr NOSHADE WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="left">

This is a maintenance release. Update is recommended but not required if you do not experience any problems.

<ul>
 <li>Bug fixes
   <ul> 
   	 <li> under MacOS, recoder.util.FileUtils correctly finds the runtime-jar file.
     <li> recoder.io.DefaultProjectFileIO no longer throws NullPointerException when
			specifying file in current directory
     <li> recoder.convenience.Naming.toCanonicalName(CompilationUnit) now allows CUs
				without any type declaration. Needed for package-info.java.
	</ul>
 <li>Changes and Additions
 	<ul>
 		<li>ClassType.getConstructors now returns List<? extends Constructor> instead of List<Constructor>.
			  Unlike methods, constructors are not inherited, so this makes the API a little bit more
			  flexible (subclasses use covariant return types)
		<li>small enhancement: static accesses to non-static members are now detected and reported
			  as errors if the reference prefix is a type reference
 	</ul>
</ul>
 		


<p>
Release notes for 0.81 (of May 8th, 2006)
<hr NOSHADE WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="left">

<ul>
<li>Bug fixes
	<ul>
		<li>Lots of bugs concerning java 5 features have been fixed since 0.80beta. AN UPDATE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
	</ul>

<li>Changes
	<ul>
		<li>VariableDeclaration.getVariables() is not modifiable any more due to implementation of ParameterDeclaration.

		<li>The type-specific lists in the recoder.list package have been replaced with a clean java 5 generic
			collections-based implementation.
	</ul>

<li>Additions
	<ul>
		<li>recoder.kit.transformation.java5to4 contains a set of transformations that convert Java 5 code and make it
	  complient to Java 1.4. There are still some bugs in the transformations dealing with generics and co-variant
	  return types.
		<li>ClassFile now stores its original data location, readable with ClassFile.getLocation()
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Release notes for 0.8beta (of February 2nd, 2006)
<hr NOSHADE WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="left">

<ul>
<li>
Additions

<ul>
<li>Java 5 support, including
  <ul>
	<li> support for static imports
	<li> support for variable number of arguments (vararg)
	<li> support for autoboxing
	<li> support for enhanced for loops
	<li> support for annotations
	<li> support for enums
	<li> support for generics
  </ul>
<li> Added project settings:
  <ul>
	<li> JAVA_5  to enable java 5 support
	<li> TABSIZE to manually set the tab size when parsing files; defaults to 8.
	          Note that this must be set before parsing to have any meaning.
  </ul>
</ul>

<li>API Changes
<ul>
<li> support for static imports required that the parent type of Identifier
  was changed from NamedProgramElement to NonTerminalProgramElement; see <a href="CodingPorting.html">Coding and Porting</a>
<li> instead of Modifiers, members now have DeclarationSpecifiers, meaning annotations + modifiers;
  see <a href="CodingPorting.html">Coding and Porting</a>
</ul>

<li>Other Changes
<ul>
<li> java.lang.Object is now always a direct superclass for interfaces,
  not only if no other supertypes were present (this is the behaviour as it is in bytecode class files)
  While this is not compliant with java language spec, it's the desired behaviour for bytecode types,
  and we think that types provided in sourcecode should behave as closely as possible to those
  provided in bytecode
<li> incorporated some improvements from the original Java 1.5 grammar for JavaCC
  (i.e., improved unicode support)
<li> types available as source in .jar files will not be loaded any more. This was only done
  when looking for types after having loaded all other source files.
  We can't think of any value in loading them delayed, as it usually leads to unresolvable
  type references
</ul>


<li>
Changes in Progress
<ul>
<li> referencing a non-static member from a static context is now reported as an error; this doesn't
  work entirely, yet.
</ul>

<li>
Bugs Fixed
<ul>
<li> Fixed a bug in JavaProgramFactory.initialize()
<li> Reset caches on changes of model element "extends"
<li> Fixed parser bug #1218730: "super" not accepted as a PrimarySuffix
<li> Constructors of static member classes may not have been parsed correctly by bytecode parser
<li> fixed a bug in JavaProgramFactory.parseLong(String)
</ul>

<li>Known issues
<ul>
<li> "Reflection import" is untested for annotations/enums and may not be complete.
  For instance, generic field/method information is not read.
<li> Naming of local/anonymous types is not compliant with JLS of any version (note that
  1.5 and 1.4 have different naming conventions for them, too). Also note that names of such types may vary from run to run, therefore
  not producing deterministic results when querying them. This may or may not be changed
  in later versions, depending on demand and time available on our account.
<li> semantics of annotations such as @Override are not evaluated.
</ul>
