Demonstrates the symbolic execution of a try-catch-finally block. 
Inside the try-block a <tt>NullPointerException</tt> is thrown. It is caught
by the first catch clause. After the execution of the catch clause is
finished, the finally clause will be executed. Although
<tt>RuntimeException</tt> is a superclass of <tt>NullPointerException</tt>, it
will not be executed in the example, as only the first matching catch
clause is entered.
