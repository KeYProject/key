// English  : Wolves, foxes, birds, caterpillars, and snails are animals, and
//            there are some of each of them. Also there are some grains, and
//            grains are plants. Every animal either likes to eat \forall S plants
//            or \forall S animals much smaller than itself that like to eat some
//            plants. Caterpillars and snails are much smaller than birds,
//            which are much smaller than foxes, which in turn are much
//            smaller than wolves. Wolves do not like to eat foxes or grains,
//            while birds like to eat caterpillars but not snails.
//            Caterpillars and snails like to eat some plants. Therefore
//            there is an animal that likes to eat a grain eating animal.
