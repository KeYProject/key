Time:60 minutes

Given:A non-empty integer array a

Challenge:Verify that the index returned by the method max() points to
an element maximal in the array.

Motivation:This challenge is an instance of Kaldewaijâ€™s Search by
Elimination [1], where an element witha given property is located by
eliminating elements that do not have that property. The challenge was
selected as it involves a relatively simple but interesting invariant,
expressing that the maximal element is in the remaining search space,
rather than maintaining the maximal element found so far.
