PROGRESS_MODE_USER=Progress dialog remains open after executing solvers
PROGRESS_MODE_CLOSE=Close progress dialog after all solvers have finished
PROGRESS_MODE_CLOSE_FIRST=Close progress dialog after the first solver has finished
infoBound=Bitvector size for this type. Use a value larger than 0.
infoSaveToFilePanel=Activate this option to store the translations \
        that are handed over to the externals solvers: \n\
        1. Choose the folder.\n\
        2. Specify the filename:\n\
        \t%s: the solver's name\n\
        \t%d: date\n\
        \t%t: time\n\
        \t%i: the goal's number\n\
        \n\
        Example: /home/translations/%d_%t_%i_%s.txt"\n\
        \n\
        Remark: After every restart of KeY this option\
        is deactivated.
infoProgressModeBox=1. Option: The progress dialog remains open after executing the solvers so that the user\
        can decide whether he wants to accept the results.\n\
        \n\
        2. Option: The progress dialog is closed once the external provers have done their work or the time limit\
        has been exceeded.
infoCheckForSupport=If this option is activated, each time before a solver is started\
        it is checked whether the version of that solver is supported. If the version is not supported, a warning is\
        presented in the progress dialog.
infoMaxProcesses=Maximal number or processes that are allowed to run concurrently
infoTimeoutField=Timeout for the external solvers in seconds. Fractions of a second are allowed. Example: 6.5
infoSolverName=There are two ways to make supported provers applicable for KeY:\n\
        1. Specify the absolute path of the prover in the field 'Command'.\n\
        2. Change the environment variable $PATH of your system, so that it\n\
        refers to the installed prover. In that case you must specify the name of the solver in 'Command'
infoSolverParameters=In this field you can specify which parameters are passed to the \
          solver when the solver is started. Note that the default parameters are crucial for a stable run of the\
        solver.
infoSolverCommand=The command for the solver.\
        Either you specify the absolute path of your solver or just the command for starting it.\
        In the latter case you have to modify the PATH-variable of your system.\
        Please note that you also have to specify the filename extension.\n\
        For example: z3.exe
infoSolverSupport=For the KeY system only some particular versions of this solver \
  have been tested. It is highly recommended to use those versions, because otherwise it is not guaranteed that\
  the connection to this solver is stable.\

SOLVER_SUPPORTED=Version of solver is supported.
SOLVER_MAY_SUPPORTED=Version of solver may not be supported.
SOLVER_UNSUPPORTED=Support has not been checked, yet.
SOLVER_TIMEOUT=Overrides timeout for this solver. Values in seconds. If value <= 0, global timeout is used.
SOLVER_INFO=Information about this solver.
