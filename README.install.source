                *     (Development Version)    *
		********************************

(1) Requirements: 
-------------------------------------

Operating System: Linux/Unix 

Java 2 SDK, Version 1.5.x or newer (already installed)

Needed additional Libraries:
	antlr.jar Version >= 2.7.2: parser generator
	javacc.jar Version >= 3.0 : parser generator
	recoderKey.jar 
                 a transformation framework for java patched by the KeY group
	junit.jar version 3.8.1: test framework
	log4j.jar

Optionally, KeY can make use of the following binaries:
	ESC Java's decision procedure 'Simplify'
        SMT-LIB provers: bindings exist currently for Yices, CVCLite, CVC3 and SVC
              (export to SMT input file possible)        


(2) Contents of the KeY-Distribution
-------------------------------------

  At the KeY-Homepage you can find the following parts:

   * README.xxx-src.txt: this file
   * KeY-xxx-src.tgz: the source code version of KeY-system
   * KeYExtLib_xxx.tgz: contains the external libraries
   * quicktour_xxx.ps.gz: a short tutorial
   * KeYDemo_xxx.tgz: example for KeY used in the tutorial


(3) Installation (Source Code)
-------------------------------------

	1) Untar the tar-gzipped file:

		tar -xvzf KeY-xxx-src.tgz

	2) Change to the created directory key-xxx

		cd key-xxx

	3) Install the needed libraries. Use the environment variable
           $KEY_LIB to point to the directory the needed libraries are
           in. If you use csh and all the needed libraries are in
           ~/key_lib use, e.g.

				setenv KEY_LIB ~/key_lib


	4) Optional: Install Simplify and/or SMT-LIB provers.

           If you download Simplify not from the KeY-website but
           elsewhere (e.g. as part of ESC/Java), follow the intallation 
           instructions given there. Then rename the Simplify binary which 
           could be named something like Simplify Simplify-1.5.4.linux 
           (Linux version) or Simplify-1.5.4.exe (Windows) to just 'Simplify' 
           resp. 'Simplify.exe'. When using Linux make sure that the file is
           is executable (you can make a file executable by issuing the
           command 'chmod a+x filename').

	   Make sure that the path where the binaries reside is included in 
           your PATH environment variable or in the KEY_LIB environment
	   variable. If not, use (e.g., in the csh to include Simplify
	   which is assumed to be located in ~/simplify):

		setenv PATH ~/simplify:$PATH

           In bash-syntax the above command is
       
                export PATH=$PATH:~/simplify

          (analog procedure for SMT-LIB provers)


	5) Change to the subdirectory ./system

		cd system

	6) Compile KeY:

		 make all (or gmake all)
	

(4) Start KeY 
-------------------------------
	
	Assuming you are still in the 'system' directory, run:

		../bin/runProver
