/**

 * to determine if the strategy should stop or continue.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The first check is done before a rule is applied on a {@link G} via
 * {@link #isGoalAllowed(ProofGoal, int, long, long, int)}. If this
 * method returns {@code false} the strategy stops and the reason shown to the user is computed
 * via {@link #getGoalNotAllowedMessage(ProofGoal, int, long, long, int)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The second check is after a rule was applied via
 * {@link #shouldStop(int, long, long, int, SingleRuleApplicationInfo)}.
 * If this method returns {@code true} the strategy stops and the reason shown to the user is
 * computed via {@link #getStopMessage(int, long, long, int, SingleRuleApplicationInfo)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Attention: </b> It is possible that a {@link StopCondition} has to check one {@link ProofGoal}
 * with the same underlying sequent multiple times. It is required that the called check method
 * always returns the same result.
