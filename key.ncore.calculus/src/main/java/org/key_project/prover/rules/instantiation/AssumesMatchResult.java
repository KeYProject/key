 * There can be several candidates for matching a formula of an assumes clause of a taclet. This

 * instantiations
 * of the schema variables that made up the assumes-formula.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is not sufficient to simply keep the match conditions as for the taclet application itself the
 * candidate information is used to decide whether to split the goal or not. See
 * {@link AssumesFormulaInstantiation}
 * and subclasses for more details.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The two lists are paired in the sense that the match conditions for the i-th candidate can be
 * found at
 * the i-th position of list {@code matchConditions}.
